Audio-to-Morse Password Manager

Overview

This app securely converts spoken phrases into Morse code, generates a unique password from the Morse sequence, and stores it in an SQL database. Think of it as an alternative way to generate and retrieve passwords without typing—just speak, and the app takes care of the rest.

Features

	•	Audio-to-Password: Converts spoken phrases into secure passwords.
	•	Morse Code Encoding: Translates your phrase into Morse code.
	•	Password Generation: Hashes the Morse code into a unique password string.
	•	SQL Storage: Saves passwords in a SQL database for easy, secure retrieval.

Development

Currently, work is underway to convert this app into a Firefox extension for added convenience.

Usage

Simply speak a phrase, and the app will generate and save the password for later use. Repeating the phrase retrieves the same password, creating a seamless, speech-based way to access your passwords.
